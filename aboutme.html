    <p>
        My name is Kaia Scheirman. I am a 21-year-old who currently resides in
        Eugene, Oregon. My hobbies include reading, psychology, and entertaining
        my perpetually unamused cat. I am a fast learner and have a thirst for
        learning that is never quite quenched.
        <br />
        I started my programming journey in February of 2021. I am currently
        completing a Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy. My goal after completion is
        to secure a job in the field of web development.
